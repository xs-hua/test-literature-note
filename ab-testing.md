## Methodology and Practices of A/B testing

*Short history:*

- A/B testing, also known as controlled experiment.
- aims originally at evaluating new product strategies and approaches. 
- First theory of controlled experiment was proposed in Sir Ronald A. Fisher's experiments at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England in the 1920s [Yates 1964]. 
- First online A/B testing Boom in the late 1990s with the growth of the internet [Kohavi et el. 2012]. 

*Limitations on A/B testing:*

- It serves as Quantitative metrics, but is lack of explanations. It indicates which variant with which cost is better, but the question "why" is not answered [Nielsen 2005]
- It only measures Short term effects.
- newness effects: newness bias [Hawthorne 2007]
- efforts for implementing newness [Kohavi 2009]
- consistency and parallel experiments [Belle 2002]

*Test approaches:*

- users are randomly exposed to one of two variants
- one variant as contraol group, the other variant as treatment group
- control and treatment [Weiss 1997]:
    1. **single variant:** 
        - time efficient
        - factors interaction can be observed
        - factors combination may give poor user experience
        - analysis and interpretation are diffcult
    2. **multiple variants:**
        - single factor test has many metrics for comparison
	    - time consuming
- Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) derived [Roy 2001]: based on which goal need to be achieved and evaluated in metrics.
- Determine statistical method to apply.
